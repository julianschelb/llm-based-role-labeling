    "One way to identify narratives in newspaper text is through considering the character archetypes relied on to compose the framing of an article. The main figures in an article may be represented as the heroes, villains, or victims in the text to guide the reader towards reading the article in context with existing qualities implicit in these character archetypes. Gomez-Zara et al present a dictionary-based method for computationally determining the hero, villain, and victim in a newspaper text, which Stammbach et al adapt by using an LLM for the same task. "

      "Title: Court chaos continues as right-wing True the Vote leaders are thrown in jail\n",
      "Text: The two leaders of the far-right group True the Vote have been hauled off to jail as of Monday afternoon, according to Votebeat Texas. Gregg Philips and Catherine Engelbrecht were told that until they follow a federal judge's order to identify the man they say is an FBI informant in a defamation case they must remain in jail. The case involves a right-wing conspiracy theory about misconduct by the technology company Konnech, which has since sued True The Vote for defamation. They allege that the group is targeting their company in a viral social media campaign that is damaging their business and it has resulted in a barrage of threats against the CEO and his family. Philips and Engelbrecht claimed that an unidentified man, allegedly an FBI agent, helped investigate the company for they say giving poll worker information to China. In fact, they're misconstruing an actual case in which the CEO, Eugene Yu is accused of compromising a very small amount of county employee voter data to China. RELATED: Top MD Republican's aide encouraged supporters to form ‘long lines’ late on Election Day \"Of course, that criminal case does not show anything resembling the election fraud True the Vote has falsely claimed went down in the U.S.\" said Votebeat Texas. The group is the same one behind the 2,000 mules movie that alleges a slew of unfounded election conspiracies. Donald Trump's insistence on pushing boundaries in his criminal cases could come back to bite him in Georgia, former Richard Nixon White House counsel John Dean said on Saturday. Dean, who testified before the Senate Watergate Committee in 1973, appeared on CNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta where he was asked about the former president's consistent attacks on those prosecuting him in various jurisdictions. Dean previously said Special Counsel Jack Smith's \"bulletproof\" indictment derailed Trump's \"free speech\" defense.      There are a number of things Judge Chutkan can do to a criminal defendant who acts out of line, but one of those things is most likely to resonate with Donald Trump, a former prosecutor said on Saturday. Former Brooklyn, NY, prosecutor Charles Coleman appeared on MSNBC's Symone and was asked about a warning Chutkan gave the former president's legal team during a hearing on a protective order. The host asked Coleman what options Chutkan might have if Trump continues to lash out against the judge, prosecution, and witnesses, but only one stood out.      Donald Trump reportedly vowed Saturday he will never accept any plea deal in any of the criminal cases against him, as prosecutors in Georgia are expected to hand down another indictment against the former president. Trump, who reporting suggests could be hit with an indictment out of Georgia as early as Tuesday of next week, has ruled out the potential for taking a deal from prosecutors, according to Forbes.

David DePape, 42, broke into the Pelosis\\' home, but the House Speaker was out of town.

    "Tokenization refers to the process of converting input text into smaller units, such as words or subwords, which are then represented as tokens. These tokens are mapped to indices in a vocabulary that the model can understand. Hugging Face provides a variety of tokenizers, each suited for different types of models. For instance, the BertTokenizer is designed for BERT-like models and tokenizes text into wordpieces. Similarly, the GPT2Tokenizer is tailored for GPT-2-like models and tokenizes text into subwords using the Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm. "

    "* Whether to add special tokens such as `[CLS]` and `[SEP]` (default is True).\n",
    "* Special tokens are necessary for some models to function properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`max_length`**:\n",
    "* The maximum number of tokens for the output (default varies, often 512).\n",
    "* Texts longer than this will be truncated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`padding`**:\n",
    "* Whether to pad the output to `max_length`, and the padding strategy (default is False).\n",
    "* Options include `'max_length'`, `'longest'`, or `True` to pad to the length of the longest sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`truncation`**:\n",
    "* Whether to truncate sequences to `max_length` (default is False).\n",
    "\n",
    "**`return_tensors`**:\n",
    "* The framework to use for the returned tensors, either `'pt'` for PyTorch or `'tf'` for TensorFlow (default is None, which returns plain lists).\n",
    "\n",
    "**`return_token_type_ids`**:\n",
    "* Whether to return token type IDs (default is True).\n",
    "* Necessary for some models to understand the different segments of input (e.g., question vs answer).\n",
    "\n",
    "**`return_attention_mask`**:\n",
    "* Whether to return the attention mask (default is True).\n",
    "* Attention masks tell the model which tokens to pay attention to and which to ignore.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`verbose`**:\n",
    "* Whether to log information during tokenization (default is True).\n",

    "**`is_split_into_words`**:\n",
    "* Whether the input is pre-tokenized into words (default is False).\n",

    "#### Parameters for Text Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Each parameter influences the text generation in a specific way. Below are the parameters along with a brief explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`max_length`**:\n",
    "* Sets the maximum number of tokens in the generated text (default is 50).\n",
    "* Generation stops if the maximum length is reached before the model produces an EOS token.\n",
    "* A higher `max_length` allows for longer generated texts but may increase the time and computational resources required.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`min_length`**:\n",
    "* Sets the minimum number of tokens in the generated text (default is 10).\n",
    "* Generation continues until this minimum length is reached even if an EOS token is produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`num_beams`**:\n",
    "* In beam search, sets the number of \"beams\" or hypotheses to keep at each step (default is 4).\n",
    "* A higher number of beams increases the chances of finding a good output but also increases the computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`num_return_sequences`**:\n",
    "* Specifies the number of independently computed sequences to return (default is 3).\n",
    "* When using sampling, multiple different sequences are generated independently from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`early_stopping`**:\n",
    "* Stops generation if the model produces the EOS (End Of Sentence) token, even if the predefined maximum length is not reached (default is True).\n",
    "* Useful when an EOS token signifies the logical end of a text (often represented as `</s>`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**`do_sample`**:\n",
    "* Tokens are selected probabilistically based on their likelihood scores (default is True).\n",
    "* Introduces randomness into the generation process for diverse outputs.\n",
    "* The level of randomness is controlled by the 'temperature' parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`temperature`**:\n",
    "* Adjusts the probability distribution used for sampling the next token (default is 0.7).\n",
    "* Higher values make the generation more random, while lower values make it more deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`top_k`**:\n",
    "* Limits the number of tokens considered for sampling at each step to the top K most likely tokens (default is 50).\n",
    "* Can make the generation process faster and more focused.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`top_p`**:\n",
    "* Also known as nucleus sampling, sets a cumulative probability threshold (default is 0.95).\n",
    "* Tokens are sampled only from the smallest set whose cumulative probability exceeds this threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`repetition_penalty`**:\n",
    "* Discourages the model from repeating the same token by modifying the token's score (default is 1.5).\n",
    "* Values greater than 1.0 penalize repetitions, and values less than 1.0 encourage repetitions.\n"
