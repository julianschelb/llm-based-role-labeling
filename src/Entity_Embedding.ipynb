      "Crackpots, Teabagistan “Here we go again, coddling the enemy and implementing rules of engagement that prohibit our military from doing its job. Iran captures our warriors before forcing the U.S. to apologize for the ENEMY’S bullying and endangerment, all to send a (false) message that America is now so weak we’ve fallen insurmountably far under the enemy. As Sen. McCain just said on Fox News, Obama spokesman Josh Ernest is an ‘idiot’ and knows not of what he speaks as actual APPRECIATION is expressed by the Leftist White House for Iran’s combatant actions. “To praise the enemy for humiliating our military should make all reasonable, pro-‘Peace through Strength’ Americans agree with what Dean Cain said on Fox this morning: ‘This makes me sick to my stomach.’ Then went on to suggest reasons many of America’s finest are leaving the military. No question, they’re leaving due to the Left’s pussy-footing around per the tone set by an extremely weak President who doesn’t believe we face existential threats. I’ll continue to ask: if democrats still praise Obama’s capitulation and bending over for Iran, does it not make you wonder whose side are they on?” – Sarah Palin, writing this afternoon on Facebook.

    "## Tokenize Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization refers to the process of converting input text into smaller units, such as words or subwords, which are then represented as tokens. These tokens are mapped to indices in a vocabulary that the model can understand. Hugging Face provides a variety of tokenizers, each suited for different types of models. For instance, the BertTokenizer is designed for BERT-like models and tokenizes text into wordpieces. Similarly, the GPT2Tokenizer is tailored for GPT-2-like models and tokenizes text into subwords using the Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm. "

    "**`padding`**:\n",
    "* Whether to pad the output to `max_length`, and the padding strategy (default is False).\n",

    "**`truncation`**:\n",
    "* Whether to truncate sequences to `max_length` (default is False).\n",
    "\n",
    "**`return_tensors`**:\n",
    "* The framework to use for the returned tensors, either `'pt'` for PyTorch or `'tf'` for TensorFlow (default is None, which returns plain lists).\n",

    "* Whether to return token type IDs (default is True).\n",

    "**`return_attention_mask`**:\n",
    "* Whether to return the attention mask (default is True).\n",

    "* Sets the maximum number of tokens in the generated text (default is 50).\n",
    "* Generation stops if the maximum length is reached before the model produces an EOS token.\n",
    "* A higher `max_length` allows for longer generated texts but may increase the time and computational resources required.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`min_length`**:\n",
    "* Sets the minimum number of tokens in the generated text (default is 10).\n",
    "* Generation continues until this minimum length is reached even if an EOS token is produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`num_beams`**:\n",
    "* In beam search, sets the number of \"beams\" or hypotheses to keep at each step (default is 4).\n",
    "* A higher number of beams increases the chances of finding a good output but also increases the computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`num_return_sequences`**:\n",
    "* Specifies the number of independently computed sequences to return (default is 3).\n",
    "* When using sampling, multiple different sequences are generated independently from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`early_stopping`**:\n",
    "* Stops generation if the model produces the EOS (End Of Sentence) token, even if the predefined maximum length is not reached (default is True).\n",
    "* Useful when an EOS token signifies the logical end of a text (often represented as `</s>`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**`do_sample`**:\n",
    "* Tokens are selected probabilistically based on their likelihood scores (default is True).\n",
    "* Introduces randomness into the generation process for diverse outputs.\n",
    "* The level of randomness is controlled by the 'temperature' parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`temperature`**:\n",
    "* Adjusts the probability distribution used for sampling the next token (default is 0.7).\n",
    "* Higher values make the generation more random, while lower values make it more deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`top_k`**:\n",
    "* Limits the number of tokens considered for sampling at each step to the top K most likely tokens (default is 50).\n",
    "* Can make the generation process faster and more focused.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`top_p`**:\n",
    "* Also known as nucleus sampling, sets a cumulative probability threshold (default is 0.95).\n",
    "* Tokens are sampled only from the smallest set whose cumulative probability exceeds this threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`repetition_penalty`**:\n",
    "* Discourages the model from repeating the same token by modifying the token's score (default is 1.5).\n",
    "* Values greater than 1.0 penalize repetitions, and values less than 1.0 encourage repetitions.\n"
